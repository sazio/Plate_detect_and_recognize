## Update
__(29/7/2020)__
- Rename `utils.py` to  `local_utils.py` to avoid conflicit with default Python library `utils.py`.
- Replace error `index out of range` to `No License plate is founded!`.
- In case error `No License Plate is founded!` popped up, try to adjust Dmin from `get_plate()` function. Keep in mind that larger Dmin means more higly the plate information is lost.
